4.7 Packages

Java allows you to group classes in a collection called a package. Packages are
convenient for organizing your work and for separating your work from code libraries
provided by others.





4.7.1 Class Importation

A class can use all classes from its own package and all public classes from other packages.

You can access the public classes in another package in two ways.

	java.util.Date tody = new java.util.Date();
or
	import java.util.*;
	Date today =  new Date();





4.7.2 Static Imports

A form of the import statement permits the importing of static methods and fields, not just classes.

import static java.lang.System.*;

out.println("Goodbye, World!");
exit(0);





4.7.3 Addition of a Class into a Package

//调用各个包内的类





4.7.4 Package Scope

You have already encountered the access modifiers public and private. Features
tagged as public can be used by any class. Private features can be used only by the
class that defines them. If you don’t specify either public or private, the feature (that
is, the class, method, or variable) can be accessed by all methods in the same package.
