4.4 Static Fields and Methods

4.4.1 Static Fields

class Employee{

	private static int nextId = 1;
	
	private int id;
	...
}
// there is only one nextId field that is shared among all instances of the class

int i = Employee.nextId;





4.4.2 Static Constants

public class Math{

	public static final double PI = 3.141592;
} 

//You can access this constant in your programs as Math.PI.






4.4.3 Static Methods

Math.pow(x,a)   // x ** a (python)

Note: recommend that you use class names, not objects, to invoke static methods

Use static methods in two situations:
· When a method doesn't need to access the object state because all nedded parameters are supplied as explicit parameters(example:Math.pow)
· When a method only needs to access static fields of the class(example:Employee.getNextId)





4.4.4 Factory Methods





4.4.5 The main Method

Note that the Employee class also has a static method for unit testing, simply execute
	java Employee
